# Practice-repository
This repository is now used for group members to practice coding daily.

This is a repository for group members to upload own code online, so that we can keep an eye on everyone's progress.

Please change your own file to upload your code. Don't use Chinese! Or some errors may occur for no reason.

Cause you are all not owners, so you only can pull request.

After you pull request your own file, remember to @ me to let me know your request. After I commit your request then you have finished your mission today.

Please remember this.
